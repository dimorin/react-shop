1. axios는 따로 service 폴더에 넣기
2. proxy 처리 (https://www.inflearn.com/course/%EB%94%B0%EB%9D%BC%ED%95%98%EB%A9%B0-%EB%B0%B0%EC%9A%B0%EB%8A%94-%EB%85%B8%EB%93%9C-%EB%A6%AC%EC%95%A1%ED%8A%B8-%EA%B8%B0%EB%B3%B8/lecture/37084?tab=curriculum)
3. useCallback, memo


# shoes shop에서 사용한 라이브러리
1. 라우터 관리 - react-router-dom 
2. 비동기처리 - axios
3. ui - react-bootstrap
4. sass - node-sass
5. 전역 데이터 관리 - redux, react-redux, redux-devtools-extension
6. icon - react-icons
# 리액트 개발시 유의점
1. 정보는 최상단 컴포넌트에서 관리한다.
2. 직잡 DOM을 조작하지 않는다. 변수나 클래스네임과 같은 데이터 변경은 리액트룰에 따른다.(useState)
3. useEffect 사용시 return 함수를 통해 unmount 처리도 잊지 않는다.
4. 테스트를 하자.
5. style={{}}, onClick={() => {}} 이렇게 하지 말고, style={container}, onClick={handlerChange} 이렇게 하자.

# UI components 구현
- button 참고 [buttonReactComponent](https://github.com/dimorin/buttonReactComponent/blob/master/src/components/button.scss)
- color 참고 [https://yeun.github.io/open-color/](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/)
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
